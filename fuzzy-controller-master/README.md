# fuzzy-controller
This fuzzy controller is based on C++. You can use triangle membership function or Gauss membership function or   Trapezoid membership function to fuzzification the input error and error ratio, and it uses Madanni model to defuzzification . In the main function we have implemented one example  which set target to 60  to verify the efficiency of this fuzzy controller, the result has proved that it does work well.
